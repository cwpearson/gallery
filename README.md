## Roadmap

- [x] use the `not_people_json` field of `faces` table to store ids of people the user has said this face is not
  - [ ] when auto-labeling, find the closest labeled face that is not one of these people
- [x] create subdirectories in the .gallery folder for images so each one doesn't have too many files
- [x] auto-hide small faces
  - [x] store original size
